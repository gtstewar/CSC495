## Bartok

```python
from Game_2 import Bartok

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = Bartok(["a", "b", "c", "d"])
    a.run()
```

Module `Game_2` is contains only `Bartok` class.

Passing a list of user name (human), the length should be less or equal to 4.

Then start the class method `run()`, we can start the game.

Ehhhhhhh..... Read the code for the rest of instruction... OR SO TO SAY RTFM...LOL...

No kidding now... If you want to choose the card, just choose the index number for the card.
The computer will take care of the rest.

Enjoy :-)

> BTW, if you are not sure about what's happening, you can pass a empty list into `Bartok` class.
> The algorithm of bartok will take care of itself, then finish all the stuff till some AI win.
> Sounds like some AlphaGo stuff lol.
