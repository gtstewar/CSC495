> This is just a README on branch `Bartok`.

## Usage

```python
from Game_2 import Bartok

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = Bartok(["a", "b", "c", "d"])
    a.run()
```

Module `Game_2` is contains only `Bartok` class.

Passing a list of user name (human), the length should be less or equal to 4.

Then start the class method `run()`, we can start the game.

Ehhhhhhh..... Read the code for the rest of instruction... OR SO TO SAY RTFM...LOL...

No kidding now... If you want to choose the card, just choose the index number for the card.
The computer will take care of the rest.

Enjoy :-)
